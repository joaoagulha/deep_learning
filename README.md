# Deep Learning

This repository contains code for established deep learning algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning tasks.

It contains Artificial Neural Networks, Convolution Neural Networks, and Recurrent Neural Networks for the Supervised section. As for the Unsupervised section, Self Organizing Maps, Boltzmann Machines, and Autoencoders were developed.
